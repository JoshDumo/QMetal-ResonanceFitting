# QMetal-ResonanceFitting
Resonance Fitting of Qiskit Metal Impedance Analysis
"ImpedanceAnalysisOneHanger" notebook is adapted from the tutorial. I just strip it down to 1 hanger and perform impedance analysis on Ansys. Not sure this is done "apprpropriately" though. In any case the S21 results are then saved to csv file.

"Resonator-2" notebook follows the lmfit tutorial basically. I then use it to try and fit the S21 results loaded from the previuosly saved csv. So far not so good.
